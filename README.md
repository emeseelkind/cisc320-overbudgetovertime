OVER-BUDGET OVER-TIME

CISC/CMPE 320 Final Project

Group 18

Project Idea:

Have you ever tried to walk from class with only a 1-hour lunch break between classes? With the new construction in Kingston, this is almost impossible! But wait, what if you could build a bridge over the construction to get home?
The project aims to create a fun and challenging game that tests the playerâ€™s knowledge of physics and structures. The game levels will increase in difficulty allowing players to adjust to the game mechanics slowly. The bridge-building menu will feature a grid that snaps bridge pieces in place, allowing for uniform and organized structures.

We decided to stop using the built in issue board in GitLab because it doesn't suit our purposes well.
